= Working with passphrase-protected keys

It is recommended not to use passphrase-protected keys with this gem.
Remember, `RSpec::PGPMatchers` are meant for testing, therefore there is
no security trade-off involved.  Nevertheless, passphrase-protected keys are
supported as well.  With some hassle, thoughâ€¦

IMPORTANT: This guide was written for GnuPG 2.2.  Other versions may require
a different set of configuration options.

== Passing the passphrase in gpg.conf

This is the easier option, however it will work only if you use the same
passphrase for all the keys.

1. Write GnuPG options to a config file located at `<pgp/home/path>/gpg.conf`:
+
----
yes
batch
no-tty
use-agent
pinentry-mode loopback
passphrase <passphrase>
----

2. Write GnuPG Agent options to a config file located at
`<pgp/home/path>/gpg-agent.conf`:
+
----
allow-loopback-pinentry
----

3. If GnuPG Agent was running, reload it to pick the updated configuration:
+
----
gpgconf --homedir <pgp/home/path> --reload gpg-agent
----

== Passphrase presetting

This is the recommended and more comprehensive solution, though also bit more
complicated.

1. Write GnuPG options to a config file located at `<pgp/home/path>/gpg.conf`:
+
----
yes
batch
no-tty
use-agent
----

2. Write GnuPG Agent options to a config file located at
`<pgp/home/path>/gpg-agent.conf`:
+
----
allow-preset-passphrase
----

3. If GnuPG Agent was running, reload it to pick the updated configuration:
+
----
gpgconf --homedir <pgp/home/path> --reload gpg-agent
----

4. Obtain keygrips of password-protected keys you want to use:
+
----
gpg --homedir <pgp/home/path> --list-keys --with-keygrip
----
+
Note that sometimes you will need a subkey's keygrip rather than primary key's
one.  Subkeys are typically used for message encryption, but can be used for
signing as well.

5. Preset passwords for keys:
+
----
gpg-preset-passphrase --homedir <pgp/home/path> --preset --passphrase <passphrase> <keygrip>
----
+
or (will read passphrase from standard input):
+
----
gpg-preset-passphrase --homedir <pgp/home/path> --preset <keygrip>
----
+
Note that `gpg-preset-passphrase` is not in `PATH` on some systems.
For instance, when GnuPG is installed on MacOS via Homebrew, it is located at
`/usr/local/opt/gnupg/libexec`, which is not in `PATH` by default.

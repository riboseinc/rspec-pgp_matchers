    # RSpec expectations can easily go multiline.  And sometimes, it's all not
    # about multiple arguments, but more about & or | operators.  Comma placed
    # after a single method argument which spans across many lines is confusing,
    # not helpful.  Hence, I'm disabling this cop for all specs.

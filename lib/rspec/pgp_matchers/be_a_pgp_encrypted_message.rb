# A following PGP matcher calls the GPG executable in a subshell, then
# parses command output.  This is a poor pattern in general, because output
# messages may subtly change over GPG evolution, and some maintenance work
# may be required.
#
# However, GPG executables do not provide any machine-readable output which
# could be used instead.  Furthermore, using RNP or GPGME from here is also
# a poor idea, because this gem is going to be tested against various
# combinations of software, in some of which that dependency may be unavailable.
#
# If parsing the output of GPG commands will become a burden, then the preferred
# solution is to develop a minimalist validator which, if executed in
# a subshell, returns some useful machine-readable output.  A validator tool
# running in a separate process may leverage GPGME, as it won't be exposed
# outside the validator.  A previous implementation of this matcher may provide
# some useful ideas.  See commit 2e2bd0da090d7d31ecacc2d1ea6bd3e13479e675.
